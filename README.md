# Build Instructions

3. The wizard will then ask you where you want to install Android studio. Choose where you want to put it and click on “Next”
4. The wizard will ask you to choose a start menu folder. The default option should work fine. Click on “Next”. The wizard will now start      installing.

## Open The Project
12. When Android Studio opens up for the first time, it will give you a list of options of what you can do. Click on “Open An Existing         Project” (if the actual Android Studio opens up, then go to File -> Open...)
13. Find the directory where you cloned our repository (in step 11) and click the item that says “MyVetPath” (It should have the Android     Studio icon next to it). Click on the “OK” button.
14. Android studio will take some time to sync all the files, run a build, and index. Wait until all these processes are done.
15. Click on the green play button near the top of Android Studio.
16. If you don’t already have a virtual device, then you will need to install one (go to step 16.A). If you do already have one, skip to step 17.
  A. Click on the “Create New Virtual Device” button
  B. Select any phone on the list (such as the Nexus 5x)
  C. Click on “Next”
  D. Download a system image by clicking on “Download” next to the API you want. We tested our application by downloading Pie (API level        28). Agree to the terms and download it.
  E. Once the components have downloaded, click on “Finish”
  F. Click on the system image you just downloaded and click on “Next”
  G. Click on the “Finish” button on the “Verify Configuration” page
